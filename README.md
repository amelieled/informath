#### LATEST NEWS

24 July 2026: New binary release, entitled [Informath-0.4](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/informath/releases/tag/informath-0.4).

22 July 2026: also verbal constants can now be defined with `#` variables, which enables permutations, as well as drops without the `#DROP` directive. See [the alternative symbol table](test/profiletest.dkgf) for examples.

10 July 2026: an experiment on porting the Informath grammar to new languages (Finnish and Czech) by help from Claude code. The process is documented in the [vibe directory](./doc/vibe/). NOTICE: these grammars are not yet an "official" part of Informath but need checking for known and still unknown bugs.

22 June 2026: macros in symbol tables now directly possible in entries of form `$...$`, e.g. `$#1 \mid #2$`, from which a macro is generated automatically; see test/profiletest.dkgf

15 June 2026: a lengthy paper on Informath in arXiv: [Symbolic Informalization: Fluent, Productive, Multilingual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.16893). At the moment, this is the most up-to-date description on some features of Informath.

9 June 2026: moved experimental and/or deprecated code to a separate repository, called [informath-experiments](https://github.com/aarneranta/informath-experiments).

6 May 2026: New binary release, entitled [Informath-0.3](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/informath/releases/tag/informath-0.3).

15 April 2026: Generalized production of synonyms, regulated by new flags `-synonyms=<int>` and `-symbolics=<int>`. Value 1 is reasonable for both of them: it means that just one verbal and one symbolic synonym is taken from the symbol table. Otherwise, the number of variations can now grow *very* large. Even without the `-variations` flag, this can make generation slow. In many demos accessible by `Makefile`, these flag values are used, but they can be overridden.

4 March 2026: Binary release, entitled [Informath-0.2](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/informath/releases/tag/informath-0.2).

## The Informath project

The Informath project addresses the problem of translating between formal and informal languages for mathematics. It aims to translate between multiple formal and informal languages in all directions: 

- formal to informal (**informalization**)
- informal to formal (**autoformalization**)
- informal to informal (translation, via formal)
- formal to formal (works in special cases)

The formal languages included are [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php), [Rocq](https://rocq-prover.org/) (formerly Coq), [Dedukti](https://deducteam.github.io/), and [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/). The informal languages are English, French, German, and Swedish. 

Here is an example statement involving all of the currently available languages. The Dedukti statement has been used as the source of all the other formats. 
```
Dedukti: prop110 : (a : Elem Int) -> (c : Elem Int) ->
  Proof (and (odd a) (odd c)) ->
  Proof (forall Int (b => even (plus (times a b) (times b c)))).

Agda: postulate prop110 : (a : Int) -> (c : Int) ->
  and (odd a) (odd c) ->
  all Int (\ b -> even (plus (times a b) (times b c)))

Rocq: Axiom prop110 : forall a : Int, forall c : Int,
  (odd a /\ odd c -> forall b : Int, even (a * b + b * c)) .

Lean: axiom prop110 (a c : Int) (x : odd a ∧ odd c) :
  ∀ b : Int, even (a * b + b * c)
```

- English: Prop110. Let $a$ and $c$ be integers. Assume that $a$ and $c$ are odd. Then $a b + b c$ is even for all integers $b$.

- French: Prop110. Soient $a$ et $c$ des entiers. Supposons que $a$ et $c$ sont impairs. Alors $a b + b c$ est pair pour tous les entiers $b$.

- German: Prop110. Seien $a$ und $c$ ganze Zahlen. Nimm an, dass $a$ und $c$ ungerade sind. Dann ist $a b + b c$ gerade für jede ganze Zahl $b$.

- Swedish: Prop110. Låt $a$ och $c$ vara heltal. Anta att $a$ och $c$ är udda. Då är $a b + b c$ jämnt för alla heltal $b$.

Any of the natural languages could also in principle be used as the source, if written in the same LaTeX code as Informath produces.
However, the translation will usually produce some garbage, which can only be excluded by type checking in Dedukti. 
Moreover, there are some language-specific lexing and parsing issues that have not been completely solved, especially for the LaTeX parts of text and for other languages than English.

More formalisms and informal languages will be added later. 
Also the scope of language structures is at the moment theorem statements and definitions; proofs are included for the sake of completeness, but will require more work to enable natural verbalizations.


## Using Informath

### From ready-made binaries

*For this method, you don't need GF or Haskell. It is available for MacOS-ARM and Linux-x86.*

The quickest way to use Informath is to

- go to the [release page](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/informath/releases/tag/informath-0.2)
- download and uncompress the binary `RunInformath` for you OS architecture and put it into some place on your path of executables; make sure its name is `RunInformath`.
- clone [this Git repository](./) (recommended) or download the source `.tgz` package from the release page and unpack it
- download and unpack the OS-independent grammar package `Informath-grammars.tgz`, and move the two .pgf files to the `share/` directory of this Git repository. Only `InformathEng.pgf` is needed if you don't aim to use other languages.
- point the environment variable `INFORMATH_ROOT` to the directory named `informath`, which is the root of this Git repository and the unpacked source package
```
export INFORMATH_ROOT=<path_to_informath>
```
After that, you can do
```
$ echo "c : Proof (Eq (plus 2 2) 4)." | RunInformath -variations
```
for a very quick example, or
```
$ make demo
```
for many more examples. 
If you are not on a Mac, you will have to change the variable OPEN in the Makefile to point to the command you use for opening .pdf files.
You should also make sure that the LaTeX packages `amsfonts`, `amssymb`, and `amsmath` are available for your LaTeX processing.

Another thing to try is
```
$ make baseconstants
```
which shows the definitions of a set of basic mathematical concepts used in many demos. 
Notice, however, that Informath is not restricted to these concepts but open to the addition of more.

The former uses only English, but if you want to see something more in another language (Fre, Ger, Swe), also do e.g.
```
$ make lang=Fre fulldemo
```
To see all options available in `RunInformath`, do
```
$ RunInformath -help
```

#### Solving a possible security issue on a Mac

- If you are on a Mac, you may be blocked by a message saying that you cannot run software from untrusted source.
There is a solution for this in security setting, described in [Mac support](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac).

### Compiling from source

If you cannot use a ready-made binary, do
```
$ make
```
to build the executable `RunInformath` and all its dependencies.
You will need to set the environment variable `INFORMATH_ROOT` to point to the directory where the `share/` directory resides (the same as where this README.md resides).

After that, you can do
```
$ make demo
```
which illustrates different functionalities: translating between Dedukti and natural languages, as well as from Dedukti to Agda, Rocq, and Lean. 

Building the system from source requires the following software:

- [GF](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/) >= 3.12 (both as executable and as the PGF library)
- [GF-RGL](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl) (the Resource Grammar Library, to be compiled from its GitHub source)
- [BNFC](https://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/) >= 2.9 (executable)
- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) >= 9.6 (executable, with some common libraries)
- [alex](https://www.haskell.org/alex/) (executable, tested with 3.5.4)
- [happy](https://www.haskell.org/happy/) (executable)


## Some test datasets

The following datasets can be processed with `RunInformath <filename>` to generate text or code even without additional options; see `RunInformath -help` to see what can be done with various options.

- [test/exx.dk](./test/exx.dk) is a set of simple arithmetic statements.

- [test/gf-lean.data](./test/gflean-data.txt) is a set of arithmetic statements in natural language, extracted from the textbook [*Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics*](https://pdfcoffee.com/mathematical-proofs-3rd-edition-chartrand-pdf-free.html) by Chartrand et al, used in [Pathak's GFLean project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01234). Some statements in this set are not yet parsed or interpreted correctly.

- [test/naproche-zf-set.tex](./test/naproche-zf-set.tex) is a set of de Lon's [Naproche-ZF](https://adelon.net/naproche-zf) statements. Try `make naproche` to directly display a LaTeX document. Use `make lang=Fre naproche` to generate French (and similarly for Ger, Swe). Some statements are not yet parsed or interpreted correctly.

- [test/sets.dk](./test/sets.dk) contains set algebra statements from a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets). Try `make sets` to directly display a LaTeX document. Use `make lang=Fre sets` to generate French (and similarly for Ger, Swe).

- [test/maps.dk](./test/maps.dk) contains statements about functions, mostly from a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#General_properties). Try `make maps` to directly display a LaTeX document.

- [test/topo.dk](./test/topo.dk) contains topology statements, with an axiomatic definition of a topological space through its open, from the Wikipedia articles of [topological space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space#Definition_via_open_sets) and [Hausdorff space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space#Definitions). Try `make topo` to directly display a LaTeX document.

- [test/sigma.dk](./test/sigma.dk) contains some examples of variable-binding constructs (sums, integrals). Try `make sigma` to directly display a LaTeX document.

- [test/top100.dk](./test/top100.dk) contains a selection of [Wiedijk's "100 theorems"](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/). Try `make top100` to directly display a LaTeX document. Use `make lang=Fre top100` to generate French (and similarly for Ger, Swe, and even for the vibe-coded experimental languages Cze, Fin, Pol).
  
- [datasets/smad.tar.bz2](./datasets/smad.tar.bz2) contains the synthetic data used in the [autoformalization experiment of Huang et al.](https://epub.jku.at/doi/10.35011/risc-proceedings-scml.1)

- [test/natural.tex](./test/natural.tex) contains the manually written top100-statements used for evaluating autoformalization in Huang et al. 


## Possible input and output formats formats

Use `RunInformath -help` to see the actually available file types and extensions. You can also use `RunInformath` on standard input, for instance,
```
$ echo "prop1 : Proof (forall Num (n => if (even n) (not (odd n))))." | RunInformath
Prop1. If $n$ is even, then $n$ is not odd for all numbers $n$.

$ echo "prop2. Every number is even or odd." | RunInformath -formalize           
prop2 : Proof (forall Num (_h0 => or (even _h0) (odd _h0))) .
```
The option `-loop` allows you to translate between individual Dedukti and natural language judgements:
```
$ RunInformath -loop
> prop1 : Proof (forall Nat (n => if (even n) (not (odd n)))).
Prop1. If $n$ is even, then $n$ is not odd for all natural numbers $n$.
> ? prop2. Every number is even or odd.
prop2 : Proof (forall Num (_h0 => or (even _h0) (odd _h0))) .
> 
```
Input prefixed with `?` is treated as natural language, all other input as Dedukti. 
You can change the source and target languages with the `-from-lang` and `-to-lang` flags. 
You can quit the loop with Ctrl-C.

## Generating synthetic data

For those who are interested just in the generation of synthetic data, the following commands (after building Informath with `make`) can do it: assuming that you have a `.dk` file available, build a `.jsonl` file with all conversions of each Dedukti judgement:
```
$ RunInformath -parallel-data <file>.dk > <file>.jsonl
```
After that, select the desired formal and informal languages to generate a new `.jsonl` data with just those pairs:
```
$ python3 ./scripts/jsonltest.py <file.jsonl> <formal> <informal>
```
The currently available values of `<formal>` and `<informal>` are the keys in `<file>.jsonl` - for example, `agda` and `InformathEng`, respectively.

An example is [datasets/smad.tar.bz2](./datasets/smad.tar.bz2), which contains the synthetic data used in the [autoformalization experiment of Huang et al.](https://epub.jku.at/doi/10.35011/risc-proceedings-scml.1). It was generated with an earlier version of Informath in Spring 2025. But the Dedukti statements contained in it can be used for generating data with later versions.

## The files in this repository

In the root, you have

- [Makefile](./Makefile), with entries for building the software as well as different demos and tests

The [src](./src/) directory contains
- Haskell and other sources
- subdirectory in [typetheory](./src/typetheory/) with generated parser and printer for the proof systems [Dedukti](https://deducteam.github.io/), [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php), [Rocq](https://rocq-prover.org/), and [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) 
- a translator from MathCore to Dedukti and vice-versa
- translations between MathCore and Informath

The [share](./share/) directory contains

- file [BaseConstants.dk](./share/baseconstants.dk) of logical and numeric operations assumed in most of the data examples, and correspoonding files for Agda, Rocq, and Lean
- file [baseconstants.dkgf](./share/baseconstants.dkgf), a symbol table for converting Dedukti constants in BaseConstants.dk to GF abstract syntax functions
- binary file `InformathEng.pgf`, the runtime grammar with only English, when generated or copied 
- binary file `InformathFull.pgf`, the runtime grammar with all available languages, when generated or copied; this is much larger and somewhat slower to use than the English-only version (you can also build a smaller one with `make multi_grammar` for just the languages you want; edit the Makefile entry to select the languages)

The [test](./test/) directory contains
- some test data as `.dk`, `.tex`, and `.txt` files (see above)
- some alternative symbol tables in `.dkgf` files

The [grammars](./grammars) directory contains

- [MathCore](./grammars/MathCore.gf), the abstract syntax of a minimal CNL for mathematics
- [MathCoreEng](./grammars/MathCoreEng.gf), Fre, Ger, Swe - concrete syntaxes of MathCore 
- [MathExtensions](./grammars/MathExtensions.gf), an extension of MathCore with alternative expressions, and corresponding concrete syntaxes
- [WikidataWords](./grammars/WikidataWords.gf), lexicon of natural language words usable mathematical concepts
- [ProperNames](./grammars/ProperNames.gf), a lexicon of mathematicians' names that appear in mathematical constants, such as "Hilbert space"
- [VerbalConstants](./grammars/VerbalConstants.gf), a small lexicon of natural language mathematical concepts
- [SymbolicConstants](./grammars/SymbolicConstants.gf), a small lexicon of symbolic concepts in LaTeX.

- [Examples](./grammars/Examples.gf), grammar rules for building lexical items for symbol tables and parsing them from examples (see below under symbol tables)
- [Informath](./grammars/Informath.gf), the top module that puts everything together

In addition to the above grammars, which are used in the actual runtime, there are directories that can be used as libraries for implementing new constants:

- [grammars/mathterms](./grammars/mathterms/), multilingual mathematics lexicon extracted from Wikidata
- [grammars/extraction](./grammars/extraction/), auxiliary grammars used for the extraction task and also imported in the lexicon modules

However, much of this is also available by combining lexical items in symbol tables (see the last section of this document).

The [scripts](./scripts/) directory contains 

- Python scripts for various tasks in the development of Informath

Of particular interest is one that prints the JSON files produced by Informath with nicer indentation. This can be useful when tracing the different steps in generation and parsing. For example:
```
$ echo "c : Proof (and (even 2) (prime 2))." | RunInformath -v | ./scripts/indent_jsonl.py
```


## The structure of Informath

The structure of Informath is shown in the following picture:

![Informath](./doc/informath-dedukti-core.png)

The diagram has four kinds of arrowheads. Solid ones mean that the operation is a total function, giving exactly one result for every input (triangular arrowheads) or possibly many (diamond). Hollow arrowheads mean partial functions which can likewise give at most one result (triangular) or many results (diamond):

 - Conversions from Dedukti to Agda, Rocq, and Lean are partial, because Dedukti is more permissive than these formalisms.
 - Conversion from MathCore to Dedukti may fail because MathCore is more permissive than Dedukti; this is because we delegate dependent type checking to Dedukti.
 - Conversion from MathCore to Informath is one-to-many, and always results in at least one value, the MathCore expression itself.
 - Conversions from English and other natural languages to Informath may fail, because the input is not covered by the grammar. They can also give many results, because the grammar accepts ambiguity; the idea is that ambiguity is ultimately checked on semantic grounds in Dedukti.

Conversions between MathCore and Informath, and extending the Informath language itself, are the most open-ended parts of the project and hence the main research focus. 

Conversions from Dedukti to Agda, Coq, and Lean and back are mostly engineering (although tricky in some cases) that has to a large extent been done for the kind of code needed in Informath. Conversions from these type theories to Dedukti rely on already existing third-party tools. Those tools are not always up to date with the latest versions of the systems, but they have their own development teams that have goals independent of Informath.

## Processing in type theory

### Type checking in Dedukti

The type checking is based on the file [BaseConstants.dk](./share/baseconstants.dk), which is meant to be extended as the project grows. This file type checks in Dedukti with the command
```
$ dk check share/BaseConstants.dk
```
The example file [test/exx.dk](./src/test/exx.dk) assumes this file. As shown in `make demo`, it must at the moment be appended to the base file to type check:
```
$ cat share/BaseConstants.dk test/exx.dk >bexx.dk
$ dk check bexx.dk
```
Since this is cumbersome, we will need to implement something more automatic in the future. We also plan to use Dedukti for type selecting among ambiguous parse results by type checking, and Lambdapi (a syntactically richer version of Dedukti with implicit arguments) to restore implicit arguments.


### Generating other type theories

Each of Agda, Rocq, and Lean will be described below. A common feature to all of them are the conversion rules of constants stored in [BaseConstants.dk](./share/baseconstants.dk), with the format as in
```
#CONV agda forall all
#CONV rocq forall All
#CONV lean forall All
```
The purpose of these conversions is to
- avoid clashes of the target systems' reserved words
- map Dedukti to standard libraries of these systems
- comply to the identifier syntax of each system

The last purpose might be better served by a generic conversion, but that remains to be done.

### Generating and type checking Agda

There a simple generation of Agda from Dedukti. At the moment, it is only reliable for generating Agda "postulates". The usage is
```
$ RunInformath -to-formalism=agda <file>
```
where the file can be either a .dk or a text file.
As shown by `make demo`, this process can produce valid Agda code:
```
$ RunInformath -to-formalism=agda test/exx.dk >out/exx.agda
```
The base file [BaseConstants.agda](./share/baseconstants.agda) is also needed for checking in Agda. It can be accessed by prepending an `open import` statement in `exx.agda`; see `Makefile` for an example.

### Generating and type checking Rocq

Generation from Dedukti is similar to Agda, but type checking requires at the moment concatenation with [BaseConstants.v](BaseConstants.v):
```
$ RunInformath -to-formalism=rocq test/exx.dk >exx.v
$ cat BaseConstants.v exx.v >bexx.v
$ rocq bexx.lean
```
This should be made less cumbersome in the future.

### Generating and type checking Lean

Just like in Rocq, type checking requires at the moment concatenation with [BaseConstants.lean](BaseConstants.lean):
```
$ RunInformath -to-formalism=lean test/exx.dk >exx.lean
$ cat BaseConstants.lean exx.lean >bexx.lean
$ lean bexx.lean
```
This should be made less cumbersome in the future.

## Symbol tables

You can generate natural language from any Dedukti (`.dk`) file, at least if it is well typed in Dedukti (which is not always necessary). However, the result will be quite bad unless you provide a symbol table with a `.dkgf` file, mapping Dedukti identifiers to GF functions. For example, the line
```
abs : absolute_value_Fun | absolute_value_Oper
```
maps the Dedukti function `abs` to `absolute_value_Fun`, which generates verbal expressions of the form "the absolute value of $x$", and to `absolute_value_Oper`, which generates symbolic expressions of the form "$|x|$".

This section explains how symbol tables work and how you write your own ones.
If you work with the binary-only distribution of Informath, you can apply it to much of your formal code by just writing symbol tables; there is no need to change the grammar and, even less, the Haskell code.

There is a default symbol table, [baseconstants.dkgf](share/baseconstants.dkgf), which works for the examples listed in this README. But for other Dedukti files, it can give strange results or even processing errors because of name clashes between that file and the default symbol table. The first aid to this is to use the empty symbol table, by passing it to the flag `-symboltables`. An example is the conversion of a Matita dump:
```
$ RunInformath -symboltables=test/empty.dkgf test/mini-matita.dk
```
If you don't want to replace `baseconstants.dkgf` but just add your own `.dkgf` files to it, you can use the flag `-add-symboltables`. Your own entries override the ones in `baseconstants.dkgf`.

Thus the mapping between Dedukti and GF is defined in `.dkgf` files, by default in [baseconstants.dkgf](share/baseconstants.dkgf), which assigns GF functions to the constants in [BaseConstants.dk](share/baseconstant.dk). The syntax of `.dkgf` files has several kinds of lines, the most important of which is the mapping of Dedukti constants to GF functions:
```
<DeduktiIdent> : <GFFunction> | ... | <GFFunction>
```
This line maps the Dedukti identifier to the different GF functions usable for expressing the Dedukti concept; the first one is considered primary and the other ones are optional synonyms. 

The most convenient way to define symbol table entries is by giving verbal strings that show how a function is applied to its arguments. 
Consider, for example, the Dedukti constant 
```
disj : Set -> Set -> Prop.
```
Then the line
```
disj : "#1 is disjoint from #2" | "#1 and #2 are disjoint" | $#1 \notmeets #2$
```
says that an application of the Dedukti constant `disj` to two arguments $X$ and $Y$ can be rendered as "$X$ is equal to $Y$". The second alternative, uses the collective predication form "$X$ and $Y$ are disjoint". The third alternative produces a symbolic expression in LaTeX's math mode (between dollar signs).

In symbol table lines, the first variant is recommended to be a **verbal** function, that is, use words instead of mathematical symbols. This condition is needed to make informalization failure-free: a symbolic function can only be used if all of its arguments have symbolic renderings, which is not guaranteed for all concepts in informal mathematics.

A GF function in a symbol table can be given in any of the following forms:

- a natural-language expression in double quotes, e.g. `"#1 is disjoint from #2"`
- a LaTeX expression between dollar signs, e.g. `$#1 \notmeets #2$`
- a GF abstract syntax constant from the Informath grammar, e.g. `disjoint_AdjC`
- a complex GF abstract syntax expression from the grammar, e.g. `AdjPrepAdj2 disjoint_Adj from_Prep`

In both natural language and LaTeX, the numbered variables `#1`, `#2`, etc, refer to arguments of the Dedukti constants.
The highest number `#k` can be at most the arity of the constant, but otherwise the order of the arguments can be permuted, and arguments can also be dropped. 
Dropping arguments is a common way to deal with "hidden arguments" in systems such as Agda and Lean, which Dedukti however has to made explicit.


### Alternative forms of symbol table entries

The above explanation of symbol tables is available in Informath release 0.4, 24 July 2026.
It is the outcome of a long history of other formats, typically less general and less handy to use.
However, Informath aims at backward compatibility and continues to support the earlier formats.
They can also be found in symbol tables in this repository.
What is more, they are sometimes needed to disambiguate example-based entries that Informath interprets in ambiguous ways.

The most typical old format uses variables `X`, `Y`, etc, instead of integer indices:
```
disj : X is disjoint from Y
```
This format has the limitation that it does not enable permutations or dropping of arguments: whatever variable symbols are used, its interpretation is always the same as
```
disj : #1 is disjoint from #2
```
When using this format, the dropping of arguments is enabled with a separate symbol table directive, such as
```
#DROP disj 1
```
giving the same effect as 
```
disj : #2 is disjoint from #3
```
There is no reason to use the `X`, `Y` formats other than backward compatibility and maybe ease of writing.

Instead of symbolic expressions between dollars, a symbol table can contain a macro symbol and a separate directive
```
#MACRO <latex_newcommand>
```
This defines a LaTeX macro, which can be used on lines that map Dedukti identifiers to GF. The `\newcommand` directive on this line is included in the file generated with the `-to-latex-doc` option. For example, the mapping
```
congruent : congruent_Adj3 | \congruent
```
gives, as the primary rendering, the three-place adjective producing "$m$ is congruent to $n$ modulo $k$". The second alternative is a macro, which is defined as a LaTeX `\newcommand` directive,
```
#MACRO \newcommand{\congruent}[3]{#1 \equiv #2 \, \text{mod} \, #3}
```
This produces the rendering "$m \equiv n \, \text{mod} \, k$".

An inlined LaTeX expression such as in 
```
congruent : congruent_Adj3 | $#1 \equiv #2 \, \text{mod} \, #3$
```
also produces a macro name "under the hood". 
This name has the format
```
\congruentMACRo
```
which may in some cases lead to clashes.
LaTeX will then give an error when processing the generated file.
The remedy is to use an explicit `#MACRO` directive.
Future work in Informath should produce guaranteedly clash-free macro names, but this is in principle impossible if the user imports unknown macro packages.

The directive
```
#BUILTIN <DeduktiIdent>+
``` 
lists Dedukti identifiers that have built-in mappings in Informath's Haskell code. 
These lines are included to prevent spurious warnings when checking the symbol table. In `baseconstants.dkgf`, they include digits and a few other functions.  

### The Informath deployment stack

The coverage of Informath can thus be extended by writing a `.dkgf` file that maps Dedukti identifiers to GF functions. If those GF functions are already available, nothing else is needed than the inclusion of the flag `-symboltables=<file>.dkgf+`. The flag `-add-symboltables=<file.dhf>+` includes `base_constants.dkgf` as one of the files. 

How to define new GF functions is covered in the [under the hood document](./doc/informath-under-the-hood.md). But this should not always be necessary, at least for English, which has a large lexicon that supports the parsing of strings into symbol table entries.


### Syntactic and lexical categories

A majority of Dedukti expressions are function applications (of the form `f x1 ... xn`), which are rendered in a category determined by the symbol table mapping of the function `f`. The resulting informalizations belong to one of the following **syntactic categories** in GF:
```
category   name              linguistic type     example
—-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exp        expression        NP (noun phrase)    the empty set
Kind       kind              CN (commoun noun)   integer
Prop       proposition       S (sentence)        2 is even
Proof      proof             Text                by Theorem 1, x is prime                 
ProofExp   theorem label     NP                  Theorem 1
Term       symbolic term     TermPrec            x + 2
Formula    symbolic formula  TermPrec            x > 2
```
The "linguistic type" here refers to a type in the [GF Resource Grammar Library (RGL)](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/synopsis/), which is used in the implementation of the grammar. The category `TermPrec` represents the set of terms with a precedence level, where a small integer controls the use of parentheses in combinations. 

Unless you are willing to modify the GF grammars and the Haskell code, you will never have to write the name of a syntactic category. 
The most intuitive way to adapt Informath to your Dedukti files is by using **example-based symbol table entries**.
The things you need to know are

- the intended **target type** of your Dedukti constant:
  - if its value type in Dedukti is `Prop`, it is `Prop`
  - if its value type in Dedukti is `Set`, it is `Kind`
  - if its value type in Dedukti is `Elem` for some set, it is `Exp`
- its **arity**, i.e. the number of argument it takes (after possibly dropping some initial arguments not to be shown in informal text)

Given this information, you can use the following formats to write symbol table entries:
```
Prop, arity 1:  
    "X is <Adj>" 
  | "X <Verb>s" 
  | "X is a <Noun>"
Prop, arity 2:  
    "X is <Adj> <Prep> Y" 
  | "X and Y are <Adj> 
  | "X <Verb>s <Prep> Y" 
  | "X is a <Noun> <Prep> Y"
  | "X and Y <Verb>" 
  | "X and Y are <Noun>s"
Prop, arity 3: 
    "X is <Adj> <Prep> Y <Prep> Z"

Kind, arity 0: 
    "<Noun>"
Kind, 1 Kind argument (type constructor): 
    "<Noun> <Prep> As"
Kind, 1 Exp argument (dependent type):
  | "<Noun> <Prep> X" 
Kind, 2 Kind arguments: 
    "<Noun> <Prep> As <Prep> Bs" 
Kind, 2 Exp arguments: 
  | "<Noun> <Prep> X <Prep> Y" 
  | "<Noun> <Prep> X and Y"

Exp, arity 0: 
    "the <Noun>"
Exp, arity 1: 
    "the <Noun> <Prep> X"
Exp, arity 2: 
    "the <Noun> <Prep> X <Prep> Y"

Exp, higher order argument x => X (Ident x bound in Exp X): 
    "the <Noun> X of $x$"
Exp, arguments A, x => X (A is a Kind that x ranges over): 
    "the <Noun> of X where $x$ is an A"
Exp, arguments X, Y, x => Z (X and Y are bounds; e.g. sum, integral): 
    "the <Noun> of Z where $x$ ranges from X to Y"

ProofExp: 
    "<Noun> ."
  | "the <Noun> ."
  | "<Noun> <Int> ."
  | "<Noun> <Ident> ."
  | "the <Noun> of <Noun> ."
  | "<ProperName>'s <Noun> ."
```
The variable names `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `A`, `B`, `x` used in the examples are special constants included in the grammar for parsing examples.
But one can also use index variables of form `#1`, `#2`, etc.
The category symbols `<Adj>`, `<Noun>`, etc. range over all words included in the Informath grammar.

So, what are these placeholders `<Adj>`, `<Noun>`, `<Prep>`, `<Verb>`, `<ProperName>`, `<Ident>`, `<Int>`?  
All but the last two are **lexical categories**, that is, categories of individual words such as "integer" and multiword phrases such as "natural number". 
`<ProperName>`s are typically last names of mathematicians, such as "Fermat", "Hilbert"; there is a list of them in the grammar file [ProperNames.gf](grammars/ProperNames.gf).
`<Ident>`s are identifiers such as "h".
`<Int>`s are non-negative integer expressions.

Informath comes with a large lexicon (of 3000 entries in English, plus over 300 proper names), from which you often pick the ones that you need in your symbol table. The lexicon consists of individual words, but they can be combined with the following rules:
```
<Adj>: 
    <Adverb> <Adj>
<Noun>: 
    <Adj> <Noun> 
  | <Noun> <Noun> 
  | <ProperName> <Noun>
<Verb>: 
    <Verb> <Prep> a <Noun>
  | <Verb> <Prep> <Noun>s
  | <Verb> <Prep> the <Noun>
```
Notice that these rules are inductive: they permit the formation of infinitely many multiword expressions. 
For a (nonsensical) example,
```
uniformly closed topological Hilbert      space
<Adv>     <Adj>  <Adj>       <ProperName> <Noun>
```
is a `<Noun>`.
You can test a candidate symbol table entry with the `-parse-example` flag:
```
$ echo "X is disjoint from Y" | RunInformath -parse-example

AdjPrepAdj2 disjoint_Adj fromPrep
```
If a result is shown, the entry is possible to use. 
You can also paste the result to your symbol table instead of using a string; this can make later processing a little bit faster.
More importantly, if the command gives many alternatives, this is a reliable way to choose the desired one of them.
(The `baseconstants.dkgf` symbol table uses explicit GF abstract syntax expressions in order to be fast and unambiguous.)

The words used internally in Informath are **abstract syntax functions** that follow a uniform naming convention:
```
<word>_<category>
```
For example,
```
even_Adj
integer_Noun
converge_Verb
```

#### Binder expressions

The complicated-looking expression forms such as
```
Exp, arguments X, Y, x => Z (X and Y are bounds; e.g. sum, integral): 
    "the <Noun> of Z where $x$ ranges from X to Y"
```
are meant for **binders**, which take **higher-order function applications** to linear terms.
A typical example is
```
$\Summa {1}{\infinity}{n}{\frac{ 1}{2 ^ {n}}}$.
```
where the variable $n$ is bound in the summation term.
The (usually avoided) verbal expression is

- The sum of the quotient of $1$ and the square of $n$ where $n$ ranges from $1$ to the infinity.

These expressions are generated from the Dedukti expression
```
sigma (nd 1) infinity (n => div 1 (square n))
```
via the symbol table entry
```
sigma : "the sum of Z where $ x $ ranges from X to Y" | '\\Summa'
```
The syntax of bindings definable in symbol tables is still an experimental feature, and not yet general enough for all common cases.



### Inspecting the Informath lexicon

The Informath lexicon contains entries from each of the lexical categories.
It can be inspected with `RunInformath` itself by using the flag `-find-gf`:
```
$ echo "vector orthogonal" | RunInformath -find-gf

vector : vector_Noun
orthogonal : orthogonal_Adj
```
This command reads standard input and treats every word separately.

Another view of the lexicon (and the whole grammar) can be obtained by the option `-all-gf-functions`, which lists all functions of the grammar with their types, as well as the languages for which they are implemented. Grepping with the category and the language focuses the view to what you are looking for:
```
$ RunInformath -all-gf-functions -to-lang=Ger | grep Adj | grep Ger

continuous_Adj : Adj 	 Eng Fre Ger
orthogonal_Adj : Adj 	 Eng Fre Ger Swe
perpendicular_Adj : Adj 	 Eng Fre Ger Swe
```
(showing a small part of the result). To see what the rendering of a given function is in a given language, you can use the `-linearize` option:
```
$ echo "continuous_Adj" | RunInformath -linearize -to-lang=Ger

stetig
```

### Type checking symbol tables

It is important that the types of Dedukti functions and GF functions match, at least in terms of arity; otherwise, informalization may cause run-time failures. Because of this, `RunInformath` provides a static checker of symbol tables, invoked as follows:
```
$ RunInformath -base=<file.dk> <file>.dkgf
```
This command checks if the types of the GF functions and symbolic macros are compatible with the types of the Dedukti functions that they are assigned to. It does not (yet) find all errors, but it can in most cases guarantee that informalization is failure-free.


### Fine-grained lexical categories

*This section is becoming less relevant for users not writing grammars themselves, now that lexical entries can be given by parsing strings.*

The following lexical categories are available for verbal renderings.
The "example" column shows how an item of this category behaves in linearizing an application of it to its arguments. At the same time, it shows how the item can be given as a string in a symbol table, which is a "no-code" method for building symbol tables.  
```
category  semantic type              example
—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adj       Exp -> Prop                X is even
Adj2      Exp -> Exp -> Prop         X is divisible by Y
Adj3      Exp -> Exp -> Exp -> Prop  X is congruent to Y modulo Z
AdjC      Exps -> Prop               X and Y are distinct
AdjE      Exps -> Prop               X and Y are equal EQUIVALENCE
Binder    (Exp->Exp) -> Exp          the function sum of X of $x$  
Binder1   Kind -> (Exp->Exp) -> Exp  the disjoint union of X where $x$ is an A
Binder2   Exp->Exp->(Exp->Exp)->Exp  the integral of Z where $x$ ranges from X to Y      
Dep       Exp -> Kind                root of X
Dep2      Exp -> Exp -> Kind         interval from X to Y
DepC      Exps -> Kind               path between X and Y
Fam       Kind -> Kind               list of As
Fam2      Kind -> Kind -> Kind       function from As to Bs
Fun       Exp -> Exp                 the square of X
Fun2      Exp -> Exp -> Exp          the quotient of X and Y
FunC      Exps -> Exp                the sum of X and Y
Label     ProofExp                   theorem 1 .
Name      Exp                        the empty set
Noun      Kind                       integer
Noun1     Exp -> Prop                X is a prime
Noun2     Exp -> Exp -> Prop         X is a divisor of Y
NounC     Exps -> Prop               X and Y are relative primes
Verb      Exp -> Prop                X converges
Verb2     Exp -> Exp -> Prop         X divides Y
VerbC     Exps -> Prop               X and Y coincide
```
The category `Exps` contains non-empty lists of expressions. The last two expressions of the list are combined with the conjunction "and" or its equivalents in different languages. 

The token `EQUIVALENCE` in the `AdjE` example is used for marking the operator as an **equivalence relation**, which has certain NLG properties that `AdjC` does not have. The token `EQUIVALENCE` does *not* appear in the linearization of the application, but is needed in example-based parsing to distintuish it from `AdjC`.

Most of the words in the Informath lexicon belong to the base categories `Adj`, `Noun`, and `Verb`. Complex categories such as `Adj2` and `Fun` have very few entries.
There are three reasons for this:

- Words of base categories have been easy to find in available resources such as Wikidata, whereas the data for complex categories is much less common.
- It is hard to anticipate all uses of a given word in the different complex categories.
- Including all of these uses would populate the lexicon with redundant information; in particular, the inflection one and the same word would be repeated in different complex categories.

At the same time, most mathematical concepts *are* of complex categories, such as a noun or an adjective with a preposition. Changing the preposition can change the meaning of the base word. To make it possible to describe this accurately by just editing the symbol table (and not the grammar), a notation for **compound lexical entries** is made available. The syntax of a compound entry is the same as a complex GF tree (as a generalization from single function symbols). Here are some examples:
```
AdjPrepAdj2 equal_Adj toPrep         -- X is equal to Y
AdjAdjE equal_Adj                    -- X and Y are equal
NounFun square_Noun ofPrep           -- the square of X
AdjNounNoun complex_Adj number_Noun  -- complex number
```
The following fine-grained categories are available for symbolic renderings:
```
  category    semantic type            example
—----------------------------------------------
  Compar      Term -> Term -> Formula  X < Y
  Const       Term                     \pi
  Oper        Term -> Term             \sqrt{Y}
  Oper2       Term -> Term -> Term     X + Y
```
The grammar contains some entries from each category. In addition to this, with the possibility to define macros in the symbol table, one can extend the `Term` and `Formula` rendering facilities without adding new entries to these categories. However, these macro definitions do not yet cover precedences and associativity, whereas GF grammar entries do. We are working on a way to enable setting them for new operators without extending the grammar.
